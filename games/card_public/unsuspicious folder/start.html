        <h1>Rex's Waterpark</h1>
        <p>Heyo! This is a Birthday and 1 year anniversary present I've made for rex_wrecks.<br>Rex's name, face, and a cover of a song have been removed to protect our identities.</p>
        <p>This is made of cobbled together code from Labyrinth and the (currently) cancelled game called<br> Cibola: Cities Of Gold, which ceased development at the start of the pandemic.<br>Plant and Dirt textures were created by Tek for said Cibola game, the rest was created by me.</p>

        <p>Playing this game on Chrome instead of Firefox will softlock you and spoil<br>a part of the game due to a bug, so probably play it on Firefox.<br><strong><ul>Controls are WASD, Arrow Keys, and Space</ul></strong></p>
        <p>Love you rex ðŸ’•</p>
        <a href="FORCE.html">Play The Game (you better be on firefox, <i>Bram</i>).</a>
        <p>Edit: I have fixed the chrome bug. But you should still play on firefox anyway cause it's better.</p>
