		<!--Description-->
		<p>You walk through the hallway, past the garage and slide<br>
		open the back door. The odor of rotten flesh sickens you.<br>
		Zombies stumbled around the yard, but when they see you they<br>
		walked towards you with their arms stretched outwards. Zombies,<br>
		eh? Kinda overused, but at least you have a story now. Or do<br>
		you? I mean, yes this is a story, but is it yours? Maybe<br>
		this is someone else's story. Surely, if this WAS your story,<br>
		wouldn't you be sure? And even if this IS your story, that<br>
		doesn't guarentee you have a purpose, as the story might also<br>
		be purposeless. The zombies are getting closer.</p>
