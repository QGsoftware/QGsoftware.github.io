		<!--Description-->
		<p>You set up the game and start your campaign. As the zombies fill<br>
		out their character sheets, you realize that YOU are now a writer of<br>
		your own story. You may share this story with the zombies, but the<br>
		story is yours most of all. You are now in the same position your writers<br>
		are in, and you wonder how deep this rabbit hole can go. You create an<br>
		NPC. It has no name, no traits, no purpose. You make it wake up in a<br>
		normal house, just like the one you woke up in. It chooses the same<br>
		choices you did, and ends up making it's own character in a D&D game.<br>
		But that's when you realize that YOU must be a character in someone's<br>
		d&d game, in someone's D&D game. Who knows how long the cycle goes on<br>
		for, where it starts and where it stops. You never had free will, the<br>
		writers always chose for you, or laid out only a few choices you could<br>
		pick. You've never been in control and you never will be. Free will<br>
		doesn't exist, but does that mean purpose doesn't either?</p>
