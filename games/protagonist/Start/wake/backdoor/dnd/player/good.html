		<!--Description-->
		<p>Nice, you roll high. You hit two orcs with the bluntside<br>
		of your axe with one swift attack. They fall unconscious.<br>
		The third one runs away in fear. The zombies cheer you on,<br>
		and you suddenly realize your purpose. The meaning to<br>
		existence is social interaction. It's making yourself part<br>
		of something bigger than just yourself. Itâ€™s making other<br>
		lives better, improving the world and the lives of the<br>
		zombies. You realize that with others your existence can<br>
		become more important than ever. This is the first of many<br>
		d&d games with your new zombie friends, and a happy life<br>
		full of socializing and smiling.</p>
