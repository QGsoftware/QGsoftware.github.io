		<!--Description-->
		<p>You decide to escape the zombies. Zombies are slow,<br>
		and they can't be very hard to outrun. Besides, you don't<br>
		want to risk getting hurt in combat. You run past them,<br>
		and climb over the fence. You notice how all the houses<br>
		look abandoned, but not in ruins. The zombie outbreak<br>
		must have happened recently. You run until the road ends<br>
		at a forest. Just as you think you're safe, you step on<br>
		loose ground and fall into a ditch. The walls are too<br>
		steep to climb up, so you're stuck until the zombies<br>
		find you. You're toast.</p>
