		<!--Description-->
        <p>Theres no way you're spending the rest of your life<br>
        in this meaningless house. There would be no reason<br>
        to do anything, no purpose. The curiosity gets the<br>
        better of you, and you want so see how "infinite"<br>
        this world really is. Gravity feels normal, so that<br>
        must mean SOMETHING is pulling you down, right? You<br>
        decide to find out. You take a deep breath, count to<br>
        three, and jump. You look up as you see the bottom of<br>
        your house getting smaller and smaller until it's gone.<br>
        There is nothing. Nothing except you, and you question<br>
        how sure you are that you aren't nothing either. You fall<br>
        for hours, weeks, years, decades. You begin to lose<br>
        track of time. You keep thinking of all the things you<br>
        should have done before you fell into the void, but it's<br>
        too late now. You can't starve or die but you're basically<br>
        dead anyway. There is nothing but the void. The void is<br>
        everything. The void is meaningless. You are the void.<br>
        You are meaningless.</p>
