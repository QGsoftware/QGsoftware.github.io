		<h1>Adventures of The Protagonist.</h1>

		<!--Description-->
		<p>You sit down on the floor of the garage. Why can't the writers<br>
     		just give you a story? Why do they insist on watching you suffer?<br>
     		If the writers won't give you a story, why should you be their<br>
     		protagonist? You aren't going to take this anymore! If the writers<br>
		want you to be their protagonist, too bad! You're on strike<br>
		now! You lay on your back and stare at the ceiling. You refuse<br>
		to do anything until the writers give you a story. You lay there<br>
		and wait. Thousands, millions, maybe billions of years. But<br>
		you won't give in! You can't! You're on strike!</p>
