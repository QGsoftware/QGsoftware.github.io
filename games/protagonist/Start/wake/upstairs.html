		<!--Description-->
		<p>You walk up the stairs and they squeak as you step. When you<br>
		reach the top, you see a door that is open at the end of the hall.<br>
		You walk to the room, and push the door open. You see a window,<br>
		a bed, and an open laptop running Quake Live. Is this your room? Could<br>
		the writers have felt bad enough about your situation that they<br>
		wrote in a room just for you? Perhaps they haven't forgotten about<br>
		you, perhaps you do indeed have a purpose! No... it can't be. If<br>
		it was your room, wouldn't you remember that you have a room? This<br>
		must be someone else's room. Perhaps you should rest, and ponder<br>
		things over.</p>
