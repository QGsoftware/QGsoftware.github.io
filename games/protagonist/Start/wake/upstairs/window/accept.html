		<h1>Adventures of The Protagonist.</h1>

		<!--Description-->
		<p>The tractor beam lifts you off the ground, and you decide<br>
		not to fight it. Maybe this is the writers leading you to<br>
		your purpose. You glide gracefully out of your window,<br>
		through the air, and into the disc shaped spaceship. The<br>
		hatch closes behind you, and you feel the weight of<br>
		gravity gradually increasing until it seems back to normal.<br>
		You look around at the room in front of you, it's a<br>
		bland room, square and made up of white tiles, each tile<br>
		about a meter long, and the room about 10 tiles across.<br>
		The room is completely empty except for a camera on the<br>
		farthest wall, but upon further inspection, you gasp and<br>
		realise it is partially biological. You quickly step back<br>
		from the eye, but you can't help staring at it. It just<br>
		looks so... alien. Figures, as you are on what looks to<br>
		be an alien ship. The half tech, half eyeball orb of<br>
		abomination turns to stare at you. The mess of technology<br>
		and biology is disgusting, yet so facinating. The eye<br>
		was a bit bigger than a softball, The pupil a dark red,<br>
		and the iris neon blue. The rest of the eye that was<br>
		supposed to be plain white, was pitch black. Various<br>
		technological bits and pieces surrounded the eye, and<br>
		held it in like a socket. You can almost feel it<br>
		staring into your soul. The sound of a door opening<br>
		distracts you from the strange, alien tech. You glance<br>
		behind you and see that a panel has opened up. A mysterious<br>
		figure slowly walks out, lifts some kind of weapon,<br>
		and takes a shot.</p>
