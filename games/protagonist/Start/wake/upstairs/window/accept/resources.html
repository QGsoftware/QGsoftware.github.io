		<h1>Adventures of The Protagonist.</h1>
		
		<hr>
		
		<!--Description-->
		<p>You duck, dodging the first bolt as your eyes quickly dart<br>
		around the room, looking for anything you can use to your<br>
		advantage. The room is completely bare, nothing decorates the <br>
		blank, bare walls except... no. Disgusting. Anything but that.<br>
		But it seems you have no choice. As the alien takes another<br>
		shot you dive against the wall, tearing the glaring eyeball out<br>
		of it's mechanical socket. It pulses in your hand as you throw<br>
		it with all your might at the hostile. It explodes on impact.<br>
		Sparks fly everywhere as the alien and the eye dissolve. A<br>
		compartment opens up, fashioned with only a single red button.<br>
		You have no option but to push it. You hear a clank, then a<br>
		BANG as a door opens and you are sucked into space. The giant<br>
		universe that surrounds you takes your breath away, your eyes<br>
		widen as you're exposed to the wonderous nebulas and galaxies<br>
		of outer space. You never realised how enormously huge the<br>
		universe really was, and in effect how extremely small you really<br>
		are. You slowly realize the futility in your existence. You<br>
		You realize how meaningless you are, how meaningless everything<br>
		is. Nothing you will ever do in your pointless little life will<br>
		ever amount to anything. In an aimless universe with no goal, how<br>
		can anything you do be important? And even if there is some mystical<br>
		purpose to reality, you have no idea what that is and you never will.<br>
		But the odds are that there isn't an answer. Nothing you can do will change the<br>
		fact that literally nothing matters. But you also realize that even<br>
		the fact that nothing matters doesn't matter. And why worry about<br>
		something that doesn't matter? It doesn't matter that you are<br>
		nothing. No one ever said you had to be something. You are useless,<br>
		but that's fine. Who ever said you need to have a use? You can ask<br>
		why you shouldn't just give up. If nothing matters, why do anything?<br>
		The answer is because there's nothing else to do. Why do people build<br>
		castles in the sand when the know that it will be swept away by<br>
		the tide the very next day? Why start up a sandbox game with no end<br>
		goal? Why wake up every morning to a meaningless existence? Because<br>
		it's something to do. Because even if it's true that nothing matters,<br>
		at least you know you did your best. It sucks, but giving up is illogical<br>
		and therefore wrong. Giving up accomplishes nothing. Trying, even if<br>
		it is meaningless, accomplishes at least something.You angle yourself<br>
		to float back into the ship, grab the handle and pull yourself back inside.</p>
