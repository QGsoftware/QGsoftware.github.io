		<h1>Adventures of The Protagonist.</h1>

		<!--Description-->
		<p>You thrash around trying to grab onto something, anything,<br>
		to pull yourself back. You grab the edge of your desk and<br>
		clamp your hands down. The tractor beam pulls at you,<br>
		it's strength increasing. Your muscles clench, trying to<br>
		hold on. Eventually it becomes too much and your left arm<br>
		gives out. You take a breath and try again, grabbing the<br>
		window curtain. Your other hand gives. You're whole body<br>
		is outside of the window now, your left hand barely holding<br>
		the curtains. The intensity of the tractor beam increases<br>
		further, and you watch as the curtain's fabric slowly tears.<br>
		With a final rip, the fabric breaks and you find yourself<br>
		zooming towards the object. You fly across the sky, desperately<br>
		trying to grab anything you can. Tree branches, rooftop<br>
		chimneys, anything. At last, you grab at the gutter of a<br>
		house and barely hold on. You pour all your energy into<br>
		staying in place, you are utterly exhausted. Powered only<br>
		by adrenaline and the fear of whatever is on that ship,<br>
		your eyes water and you clamp harder onto the gutter. You<br>
		gasp in oxygen, trying to give your body the energy it<br>
		needs to function. You scream, but no sound comes out. Your<br>
		vision blurs, and you grunt as it fades to darkness.</p>
		
		<p>When you wake up, you're on the ground. You sit up,<br>
		and get a sharp pain in your side. Your head throbs,<br>
		you're exhausted, but you're alive, and you worked hard<br>
		to be that way. You wonder how long it's been since you<br>
		passed out. You look up at the stars, and realise your<br>
		purpose. The meaning of existence is working hard. It's<br>
		doing the best you can, and working towards your goals.</p>
